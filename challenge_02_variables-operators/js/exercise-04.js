    What would each of these lines of code do:

    1. true && console.log("moo");
    2. false && console.log("moo moo?")
    3. true || console.log("hello friend");
    4. false || console.log("bye friend");

    Once you see the results, write in a comment why it works that way
*/

// 1. will log "moo" to the console because both operands are evaluated, and both are true.

// 2. will not log anything because the first operand is false, so the second operand is not evaluated.

// 3. will not log anything because the first operand is true, so the second operand is not evaluated.

// 4. will log "bye friend" to the console because the first operand is false, so the second operand is evaluated and executed.
